## What is ACTFUN?

ACTFUN is a **Pump.fun-style token launchpad built natively on Arc Network** — but with a twist that changes everything.

Instead of buying into a bonding curve, **your community earns the token supply by writing funny posts**. Every mine is a real on-chain transaction. The mining fee goes directly into a liquidity pool. When 95% of the supply is mined within the graduation window, the token automatically graduates and opens for live trading via a built-in constant-product AMM (x\*y=k). No external DEX. No migration. No rug.

> **ACTFUN is what Pump.fun would be if the community actually earned the supply — and got to watch it happen live.**

## What Makes ACTFUN Different

| | Pump.fun | ACTFUN |
|---|---|---|
| Token distribution | Bonding curve buy | **Community mines 95% of supply** |
| Liquidity source | Creator provides | **Mining fees auto-seed the pool** |
| DEX | External (Raydium) | **Built-in AMM + UNITFLOW V3** |
| Launch requirement | Instant | **Community-mined graduation window** |
| Team allocation | Often yes | **Zero — 5% is LP reserve only** |
| Creator tool | None | **Go Live: WebRTC stream + chat** |
| Participation | Passive buying | **Active — write something funny** |
| Backend | Centralized servers | **100% onchain — pure RPC** |
| Failure mode | Creator rugs | **Refund mechanism if not graduated** |
| Data layer | Off-chain | **Goldsky indexed live feed** |

## Architecture

### Factory → Launcher → Token Flow

![ACTFUN Architecture](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amathxbt/actfun/main/public/assets/architecture-light.png)

**LaunchpadFactory** (`0xD3a6...7a4B`) deploys two contracts per token:
1. **LaunchToken** — standard ERC-20 with `imageUri` stored on-chain
2. **TokenLauncher** — per-token miner + AMM that owns the token and mints supply

The factory registers every launcher on-chain. Only factory-created launchers are trusted by the UI.

---

## Tokenomics (per launched token)

```
Total Supply
├── 95%  Mineable by community (via funny posts)
└──  5%  LP reserve (auto-minted to contract on graduation)

Mining Fee  → set by creator (e.g. 1 USDC per mine)
            → 100% flows into contract treasury
            → Becomes initial USDC reserve in the AMM on graduation

On Graduation:
  • Initial token reserve = 5% of total supply
  • Initial USDC reserve  = all accumulated mining fees
  • Creator-selected AMMs seeded (UNITFLOW V3, Uniswap V2, Curve StableSwap)
  • LP NFT held forever by the contract — no rug possible

AMM Formula:
  tokensOut = usdcIn × tokenReserve / (usdcReserve + usdcIn)   (x·y=k)
```

**No pre-mine. No team wallet. No VC allocation. The creator gets community glory and a Go Live button.**

---

## Features

### 🏠 Homepage — Token Grid
- **New / Trending / Graduated tabs** — live mining progress bars, miner counts
- **Search** — find tokens by name or symbol
- **⛏️ "You mined" badge** — your grid highlights every token you've contributed to
- **Auto-hides expired tokens** — tokens that didn't graduate within their window disappear automatically
- **Global Live Feed** — real-time on-chain activity from every token on the platform

### 🚀 Create Token
- Deploy a full ERC-20 + AMM contract pair in one transaction
- Set name, symbol, image (emoji, URL, or uploaded photo), max supply, mine amount, cooldown, daily cap, fee per mine
- **Refund window** — configurable by creator (platform default: 1 hour = 3600 seconds)
- **Post-launch share screen** — immediately after deployment confirms:
  - Token image, name, symbol
  - **"Share on X"** — one-click tweet with pre-filled text and OG share link
  - **"Copy link"** — copies the share URL to clipboard
  - **"Share Card"** — opens the visual card page
  - **"Go to token page"** — navigate directly to mining/swap page
  - **Arcscan link** — verify the contract on-chain

### ⛏️ Mine Page (pre-graduation)
- **Write something funny** — your post is recorded permanently on-chain via the `ActedFun` event
- **Mining progress bar** — live % toward graduation
- **Graduation countdown** — live timer counting down to the refund deadline; turns red in the final 10 minutes
- **Cooldown display** — live countdown to next mine
- **Funny post activity feed** — see everyone's mining posts in real time
- **Leaderboard** — top miners ranked by total tokens mined
- **Graduation alerts** — browser toast notifications at 75% mined and on graduation

### 💱 Swap Page (post-graduation)
- **Buy tokens** — direct USDC → token swap via creator-selected AMMs (UNITFLOW V3, Uniswap V2, or Curve StableSwap)
- **Sell tokens** — two-step approve + sell flow (ERC-20 approve handled automatically)
- **Live price chart** — full trade history rendered as a price chart, built from on-chain Swap events
- **Price stats** — current price, all-time high, all-time low, total trades
- **Share on X** — one-click tweet with card link that renders a rich image preview

### 🃏 Shareable Token Cards
Every token gets a shareable card page and X-optimized image preview.

**Share URL:** `actfun.xyz/api/share/:launcherAddress`

When posted on X:
- X's bot gets proper `twitter:card: summary_large_image` meta tags
- A **1200×630 PNG card image** is generated on-demand server-side showing:
  - Token image / emoji
  - **🎓 WON** (green), **💀 LOST** (red), or **⛏️ MINING** (blue) status badge
  - Mining progress bar with % and miner count
  - Top 3 community mining posts as a chat thread
  - ACTFUN branding

When a real user clicks the link:
- Redirected to `/card/:address` — a full visual card page with share/copy buttons and a "Trade this token" CTA

### 🎥 Creator Livestream
- **Go Live button** — creator broadcasts directly from the token page (no streaming account needed)
- **WebRTC peer-to-peer** — video streams from creator to all viewers in real time
- **Live chat** — full chat alongside the stream, works for creator and viewers
- **Viewer count** — live count of how many people are watching
- **Auto-detects live status** — viewers see a pulsing 🔴 LIVE badge when creator is streaming

### 🔔 Graduation Alerts
- Tracks every token you've mined in browser localStorage
- Background poller checks progress every 45 seconds
- **🔥 75% milestone** — amber toast notification: "Almost there, mine now!"
- **🎓 Graduation** — green toast: "It's trading live!"
- Each notification fires exactly once, auto-dismisses after 9 seconds, click to navigate

### 📡 Global Live Feed
Powered by **Goldsky Turbo** pipeline streaming Arc testnet events into Neon Postgres.
- Shows **all** on-chain activity across every ACTFUN token
- Filter by: All / Mines / Buys / Sells / Graduations
- Live pulse indicator when new events arrive
- Pause button to freeze the feed
- Each row shows: token image, user address, event type, amount, funny post text, timestamp
- **"Powered by Goldsky"** badge — real-time infrastructure

### 💰 Refund Window
If a token does not graduate before the refund deadline expires:
- The token page shows an **"Expired"** badge
- A **"Claim Your USDC Refund"** section appears at the bottom of the right panel
- Live **countdown timer** shows how long until the refund window opens
- Each miner sees their **claimable USDC amount** (all fees they paid)
- One-click **Claim Refund** button — contract sends USDC back to the wallet
- If already claimed, shows "Refund claimed!" confirmation
- Only wallets that actually mined the token can claim

The refund logic is enforced in Solidity:
- `claimRefund()` only works if `!graduated` AND `block.timestamp > createdAt + refundWindowSeconds`
- `claimableRefund(user)` returns `feePaid[user]` when the window is expired
- `refundWindowOpen()` returns `true` while the window is still open

### 📊 Contract Info Panel
- Launcher address (Arcscan link)
- Token contract address
- Cooldown, daily max, fee per mine, graduation window
- Creator address

## Event Indexing & Data Infrastructure

### Goldsky Turbo Pipeline → Neon Postgres

Historical event data is NOT read via RPC `getLogs` in the browser. A **Goldsky Turbo** pipeline (`actfun-analytics`) streams matching Arc testnet raw logs into a Neon Postgres table `public.actfun_events`:

- `GET /api/onchain-events?addresses=<csv>&events=<csv>&limit=<n>` — queries Neon, decodes each row with viem `decodeEventLog`
- Browser never touches Postgres directly
- If the table doesn't exist, the endpoint returns `{ events: [] }` gracefully
- Consuming hooks: `useGlobalFeed`, `useLauncherEvents`, `usePriceHistory`

### Goldsky Subgraph (GraphQL)

A separate Goldsky **subgraph** (`actfun/1.0.1`) provides a GraphQL API:
- Factory pattern: `TokenCreated` spawns `TokenLauncher` template
- `TokenGraduated` spawns `UnitFlowV3Pool` template per pool
- Entities: `Token`, `Mine`, `Graduation`, `RefundClaim`, `Swap`
- GraphQL API: `https://api.goldsky.com/api/public/project_cmpo47hdxggoa01tld31sbkfy/subgraphs/actfun/1.0.1/gn`

## Running Locally

**Requirements:** Node.js 24, pnpm 10, MetaMask

```bash
git clone https://github.com/actfun/actfun.git
cd actfun
pnpm install

# Frontend dApp
pnpm --filter @workspace/actfun run dev

# API server — needed for livestream + OG cards
pnpm --filter @workspace/api-server run dev

# Typecheck everything
pnpm run typecheck
```

**Add Arc Testnet to MetaMask:**
| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Network Name | Arc Testnet |
| RPC URL | `https://rpc.testnet.arc.network` |
| Chain ID | `5042002` |
| Symbol | `USDC` |
| Explorer | `https://testnet.arcscan.app` |

Get testnet USDC from the [Arc faucet](https://faucet.testnet.arc.network).

---

## Deploy Contracts

```bash
cd contracts
npm install
echo "PRIVATE_KEY=0xyourkey" > .env
CI=true npm run deploy-launchpad
# → Outputs new LaunchpadFactory address
# → Update artifacts/actfun/src/lib/contracts.ts with the new address
```

> Hardhat requires `viaIR: true` in `hardhat.config.js` to avoid stack-too-deep errors on LaunchpadFactory.

---

## Why Arc Network?

Arc is an EVM-compatible L1 built for speed. Sub-second finality is what makes ACTFUN feel alive:

- **Mining cooldowns feel instant** — transaction confirms before you finish reading the success message
- **Graduation window** — tight enough to create real urgency, fast enough to not frustrate
- **Live leaderboard** — updates in near real time as mines confirm
- **AMM swaps** — settle before you blink
- **Negligible gas** — anyone can mine without worrying about fees eating their rewards

ACTFUN is the first launchpad native to Arc testnet, purpose-built to show what happens when you combine EVM speed with zero-backend architecture and community-driven tokenomics.

## Architecture Decisions

**Why no backend for core flows?**
Everything that matters — supply, fees, graduation, refunds — lives in Solidity. The API server only handles WebSocket signaling for livestream and OG card generation. If the server goes down, the launchpad still works 100%.

**Why a graduation window?**
It creates urgency. A token either catches fire or it doesn't. This prevents zombie tokens from sitting unfinished and gives the homepage a constantly fresh grid.

**Why built-in AMM + UNITFLOW V3?**
On-chain graduation is fully automatic and atomic. No migration transaction. No external dependency. The LP NFT is locked forever in the contract — no one can remove liquidity. The mining fees that went in come out as the initial liquidity.

**Why funny posts?**
Mining requires a string argument. Making it a funny post turns a mechanical fee payment into a social action. The activity feed becomes readable entertainment. The token with the best posts wins cultural mindshare.

**Why the refund mechanism?**
If a token doesn't gain enough community traction to graduate, miners shouldn't lose their USDC. The contract tracks `feePaid[user]` for every miner and allows a full refund after the window expires. This creates a safe, no-risk participation model.

## Security Model

All economic invariants are enforced in Solidity — not in React:

| Invariant | Enforcement |
|---|---|
| Supply cap | Contract reverts if `mineableSupply` exceeded |
| Cooldown | Per-wallet, stored on-chain, enforced in `mine()` |
| Daily cap | Per-wallet per day, on-chain counter |
| AMM reserve integrity | Miners cannot reclaim fees that seeded liquidity |
| Graduation | Irreversible once triggered, fully automatic |
| Refund eligibility | Only after refund window expires without graduating |
| Factory trust | Only launchers deployed by LaunchpadFactory are valid |
| LP lock | LP NFT held by TokenLauncher forever — no rug |
